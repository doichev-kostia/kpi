## Task

8 queens problem:
Make an algorithm to find a solution to place 8 queens without intersections.

## Input:
8 chess pieces (queens)
a board with 8x8 cells
Informed search algorithm: 
- A*
Uninformed search algorithm:
- LDFS
Function:
- number of queens that beat each other

Logically, it's clear that only 1 queen can be placed on each horizontal and vertical line.
