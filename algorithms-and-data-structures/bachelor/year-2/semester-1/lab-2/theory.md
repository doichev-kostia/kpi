# Theoretical background

## 8 queens problem

The 8 queens problem is a puzzle that consists of placing 8 queens on a chessboard without them being able to beat each other.
We can significantly decrease the number of possible solutions by 
excluding the solutions where queens are placed on the same horizontal, vertical line or diagonal line.

## Informed search algorithms

Informed search algorithms are algorithms that use a heuristic function to estimate the cost of a path to the goal.
